In the assignment for exercise 1, we had to follow a tutorial on how to create a multi-component Java application that uses Maven and swing GUI interface.
For exercise 2, we used the knowledge we gained from watching the tutorial and implemented it on our cash register code which we made for assignment 3. However, for this assignment, we used the cash register code to only include the Scanner and Didsplay I/O.
The purpose of the exercise was to make a Cash Register that reads the barcodes of the products the customer chose and to display the details of the product such as name and price on the display.
